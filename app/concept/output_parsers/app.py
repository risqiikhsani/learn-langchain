# The information here refers to parsers that take a text output from a model try to parse it into a more structured representation. 
# More and more models are supporting function (or tool) calling, which handles this automatically. 
# It is recommended to use function/tool calling rather than output parsing. 

# Output parser is responsible for taking the output of a model and transforming it to a more suitable format for downstream tasks. 
# Useful when you are using LLMs to generate structured data, or to normalize output from chat models and LLMs.
