# # Few-shot prompting: 
# # A technique for improving model performance by providing a few examples of the task to perform in the prompt.


# One of the most effective ways to improve model performance is to give a model examples of what you want it to do. The technique of adding example inputs and expected outputs to a model prompt is known as "few-shot prompting". The technique is based on the Language Models are Few-Shot Learners paper. There are a few things to think about when doing few-shot prompting:

#     How are examples generated?
#     How many examples are in each prompt?
#     How are examples selected at runtime?
#     How are examples formatted in the prompt?
